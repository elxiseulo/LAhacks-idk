I have no idea what I'm going to do but im sure it'll be fantastic and stuff and you gonna learn okay...? 

My name is Leslie OU and this is my first repository that ive created ever and I think this is pretty cool and now I sorta reret the name of my project but it's okay because it's how it is. I'm 20. I'm hella lost on what I want to do in life and I'm just typing random shit right now. And I really think about my friend, katrina too much and I just want to stop but I can't. Okay, I think this is enough information
